What I love about picking up new hobbies is that often times I’ll stumble into a whole new world and community of people united by some like minded passion, always a medium for human expression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week, I’ve been focusing on learning how to edit photos. I subscribed to lightroom and started working on a few of the pictures I’d taken these past few weeks. I’m honestly amazed at how much of a difference it makes, even tiny adjustments. Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Pre Edit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Post Edit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49327004632_1b0742a203_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pre-edit sister and mom&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49327012877_0ff744e405_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;post-edit sister and mom&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, whether that difference is positive or not I am not sure. I imagine that there is bad and good in editing, but that the direction you take the editing is really what makes it your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But dang, time flies by when you’re editing especially for someone like me who has no idea what he’s doing. I’ll spend an hour editing a photo and be proud, but then when I take another look I realize it’s horrible. Nevertheless, I get enjoyment out of an iterative process of learning like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the first pictures I tried is of my Yuzu Shio from Afuri, a well known japanese ramen chain that established its first ramen shop outside of japan in Portland, OR. I first tried this ramen in Tokyo and I was so happy to hear they opened in Portland. The broth of this signature ramen is very bright and bursting with flavor. I wanted to see if I could convey all this with a tiny bit of editing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Pre Edit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;Post Edit&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49326910301_0b647c2de7_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;pre-edit of afuri ramen&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49326333588_0674ba4c74_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;post-edit of afuri ramen&quot;&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used to dislike the idea of post editing and photoshop, long before I even started thinking about photography. I imagine that many people probably have had this same feeling, that technology is so powerful that it sometimes in some ways enroaches upon truth and authenticity, enroaches upon the beauty of seeing something for what it is, knowing that its representation is pure, unbiased. But I think there is more to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A map should be accurate and correct. A photograph, however, can be more than just an image. A photograph can be a story. And a story is not simply generated, it is written.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[A Merry Christmas]]></title><description><![CDATA[Since my birthday (Dec 13) and christmas are so close to one another, I've recently been getting so much love from family, friends, and my so.

And last week, as I was in the ER I distinctly remember my dad and sister waiting patiently next to my bed all night long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t felt this thankful for the people around me in so long. Today, I enjoyed some beautiful family time leisurely enjoying a rare moment when all of us are together. We started the morning off at one of my favorite brunch places in Portland and honestly the US: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yelp.com/biz/screen-door-portland&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot;&gt;Screen Door&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My future brother-in-law Sean Lee gifted me a Fuji XF35mmF2 R WR last night so this Christmas Eve I got the chance to play around with it and it was truly a thing of beauty. Really enjoying this lens for portraits. In general, although I’m a complete novice, I think I’ve already fallen in love with the natural color of my Fuji X-T30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After brunch, we lazed around, drank coffee, ate dinner, and watched Klaus. Klaus was honestly one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever watched. Also, my sister roasted these delicious chestnuts and I made a nice V60 pour over with a Stumptown blend. It was nice. It felt right.&lt;/p&gt;

Next semester, I’ll be (knock on wood) graduating Rice with a BS in Computer Science. It’s crazy to think about. This morning as I was walking my dog and enjoying the crisp morning air of Oregon, I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of sadness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49267796113_0b8db3b98f_c.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;a picture of my dog teddy&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I came home for the break, I grabbed coffee with one of my closest friends who had just graduated and we reminsced about our past 4 years at Rice together. I asked him how he felt about leaving Rice and he said something that really stuck out to me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We spend so much time thinking about the past and grinding for the future that we squeeze out the present”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I think he captured what had really been lodged in my heart for some time now. This uneasy feeling of misplaced nothingness, doing so much yet feeling so little. I remembered then, another memorable quote from the final blog post of a retiring software engineer and founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My time for doing has come to an end. My time for being has begun”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don’t know if this is selfish or naive of me, but I would very much like those two times to coincide in my life, for all of my life. I don’t want to squeeze out the present anymore, but to enjoy and savor it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s the reason behind V3, the third overhaul of my personal website. This will hopefully be a centralized place for me, for the things that I care about and the thoughts in my head.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>

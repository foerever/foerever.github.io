It was challenging in the most infuriating and trivial ways. Now, with just a little bit more experience under my belt I laugh at those frustrations along with millions of other developers. The classic misplaced semicolon breaking your entire program or a misjudgement in variable assignment leading to some discrete mutation bug. It’s now become a part of development (oof) and almost a rite of passage to becoming a developer.</p>\n<p>But for new developers, it’s so much more. When you don’t know what you don’t know, these tiny challenges can become a huge barrier to entry. And for those who are not privileged or lucky enough to meet the right mentorship or resources, it can be the end of something that could have been incredible.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 799px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/eecba/coding_meme.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 77.7221526908636%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <picture>\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/8ac56/coding_meme.webp 240w,\n/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/d3be9/coding_meme.webp 480w,\n/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/a2266/coding_meme.webp 799w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\"\n          type=\"image/webp\"\n        />\n        <source\n          srcset=\"/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/5a194/coding_meme.jpg 240w,\n/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/8a430/coding_meme.jpg 480w,\n/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/eecba/coding_meme.jpg 799w\"\n          sizes=\"(max-width: 799px) 100vw, 799px\"\n          type=\"image/jpeg\"\n        />\n        <img\n          class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n          src=\"/static/313bd078e9e5a829e5da6458731b00ff/eecba/coding_meme.jpg\"\n          alt=\"coding meme\"\n          title=\"coding meme\"\n          loading=\"lazy\"\n          style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        />\n      </picture>\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p>I remember my first hackathon, HackRice 6. I was incredibly lucky to be on a team of incredibly gifted and experienced developers who walked me gently through the process. They patiently answered my “stupid questions” and even tolerated it when I told the judges that we would have had a backend if we had just a few more minutes to add “sql” and “php”.</p>\n<p>The following hackathons went similarly, with my ability to contribute growing rapidly. Finally, I remember feeling like I had “broken the barrier” to actually making cool stuff on my own when I went to PennApps XVI alone. There, an engineer and some random new friends from the University of Maryland (shout out to Tim Chen) spent hours in the middle of the night guiding me through the most difficult aspects of building my first “fullstack” webapp.</p>\n<p><strong>I was so happy.</strong></p>\n<p>I was so happy in fact that I decided I wanted to host a workshop for my fellow students back at Rice to build their first website within an hour. That year I was a freshman representative for Rice’s CS Club and one of the things the officer board was struggling most with was engagement. You have to understand, Rice is a tiny school of around 4,000 total undergrads. When I was a freshman, the previous graduating class of CS majors was something like 15-20 students.</p>\n<p>That first workshop drew in nearly a 100 students. As I “taught” this <a href=\"https://github.com/handsomericestudent/handsomericestudent.github.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">very simple workshop for making a github pages website</a>, the other officers who were exceedingly talented and extraordinarily skilled in development were going around helping students in the same gentle, non-judgemental manner I had been helped by so many others.</p>\n<p>I realized, wow this is the beautiful and enduring face of the development community.</p>\n<p>Now granted, it’s not always like that. I think my stackoverflow account was almost banned and somewhat accosted for asking stupid questions when I first made it. But even that aspect of the stackoverflow community has been addressed over the years, perhaps not fully but I’ve definitely noticed the change. And there are definitely many toxic aspects of the tech world that anybody who has even slightly experienced it can tell you about in great detail.</p>\n<p>In any case, the warmer side of the development community is remarkable and growing. There are countless more stories I could tell of the generosity of my peers and mentors, who have helped me so much. And when I ask them how I could ever repay them, they always tell me the same thing. Pay it forward.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/coding/a-barrier-to-entry","tagSlugs":["/tag/coding/","/tag/opinion/","/tag/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-05T08:53:05.742Z","description":"When I came into Rice as a freshman, coding was a completely foreign concept to me.

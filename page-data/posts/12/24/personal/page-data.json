This morning as I was walking my dog and enjoying the crisp morning air of Oregon, I couldn’t help but feel a tinge of sadness.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49267796113_97197e6c6b_o.jpg\" alt=\"a picture of my dog teddy\"></p>\n<p>Before I came home for the break, I grabbed coffee with one of my closest friends who had just graduated and we reminsced about our past 4 years at Rice together. I asked him how he felt about leaving Rice and he said something that really stuck out to me. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“We spend so much time thinking about the past and grinding for the future that we squeeze out the present”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And I think he captured what had really been lodged in my heart for some time now. This uneasy feeling of misplaced nothingness, doing so much yet feeling so little. I remembered then, another memorable quote from the final blog post of a retiring software engineer and founder.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“My time for doing has come to an end. My time for being has begun”.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I don’t know if this is selfish or naive of me, but I would very much like those two times to coincide in my life, for all of my life. I don’t want to squeeze out the present anymore, but to enjoy and savor it.</p>\n<p>That’s the reason behind V3, the third overhaul of my personal website. This will hopefully be a centralized place for me, for the things that I care about and the thoughts in my head.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/12/24/personal","tagSlugs":["/tag/personal/","/tag/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-24T10:24:01.096Z","description":"This is probably my last winter break as a student.

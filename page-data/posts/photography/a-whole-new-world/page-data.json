What I love about picking up new hobbies is that often times I’ll stumble into a whole new world and community of people united by some like minded passion, always a medium for human expression.</p>\n<p>This week, I’ve been focusing on learning how to edit photos. I subscribed to lightroom and started working on a few of the pictures I’d taken these past few weeks. I’m honestly amazed at how much of a difference it makes, even tiny adjustments. Here’s an example:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Pre Edit</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Post Edit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49327004632_1b0742a203_c.jpg\" alt=\"pre-edit sister and mom\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49327012877_0ff744e405_c.jpg\" alt=\"post-edit sister and mom\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Now, whether that difference is positive or not I am not sure. I imagine that there is bad and good in editing, but that the direction you take the editing is really what makes it your own.</p>\n<p>But dang, time flies by when you’re editing especially for someone like me who has no idea what he’s doing. I’ll spend an hour editing a photo and be proud, but then when I take another look I realize it’s horrible. Nevertheless, I get enjoyment out of an iterative process of learning like this.</p>\n<p>One of the first pictures I tried is of my Yuzu Shio from Afuri, a well known japanese ramen chain that established its first ramen shop outside of japan in Portland, OR. I first tried this ramen in Tokyo and I was so happy to hear they opened in Portland. The broth of this signature ramen is very bright and bursting with flavor. I wanted to see if I could convey all this with a tiny bit of editing.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"center\">Pre Edit</th>\n<th align=\"center\">Post Edit</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49326910301_0b647c2de7_c.jpg\" alt=\"pre-edit of afuri ramen\"></td>\n<td align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49326333588_0674ba4c74_c.jpg\" alt=\"post-edit of afuri ramen\"></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I used to dislike the idea of post editing and photoshop, long before I even started thinking about photography. I imagine that many people probably have had this same feeling, that technology is so powerful that it sometimes in some ways enroaches upon truth and authenticity, enroaches upon the beauty of seeing something for what it is, knowing that its representation is pure, unbiased. But I think there is more to it.</p>\n<p>A map should be accurate and correct. A photograph, however, can be more than just an image. A photograph can be a story. And a story is not simply generated, it is written.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/photography/a-whole-new-world","tagSlugs":["/tag/photography/","/tag/editing/","/tag/blog/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-01-04T11:00:45.996Z","description":"I've been spending a lot of time watching youtube videos about photography and it's been actually very eye opening.

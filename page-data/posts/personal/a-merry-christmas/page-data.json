Really enjoying this lens for portraits. In general, although I’m a complete novice, I think I’ve already fallen in love with the natural color of the Fuji X-T30.</p>\n<p>After brunch, we lazed around, drank coffee, ate dinner, and watched Klaus. Klaus was honestly one of the most beautiful things I’ve ever watched. Also, my sister roasted these delicious chestnuts and I made a nice V60 pour over with a Stumptown blend. It was nice.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/posts/personal/a-merry-christmas","tagSlugs":["/tag/personal/","/tag/blog/","/tag/photography/"]},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-12-25T09:54:02.526Z","description":"Today, I enjoyed some beautiful family time leisurely enjoying a rare moment when all of us are together.

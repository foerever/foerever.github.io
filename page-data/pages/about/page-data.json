My name is Sung Soo (Anthony) Cho. I’m currently a senior pursuing a BS in Computer Science with a specialization in high performance data platforms at <a href=\"https://www.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice University</a>. After graduation, I look forward to joining a healthcare startup in San Francisco called <a href=\"https://grandrounds.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Grand Rounds</a> as a software engineer on the data platform services team.</p>\n<p>While at Rice I’ve been most involved with the <a href=\"http://csclub.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice CS Club</a> and <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice Entrepreneurship Community</a>. I currently serve as President of Rice CS Club. I’ve previously served as External Vice President, Treasurer, HackRice 6 &#x26; 7 organizer, and Freshman Representative. My partner and I have won 11,000 USD from the LILIE New Entrepreneurs Grant and Rice Undergraduate Elevator Pitch Competition.</p>\n<p>Beyond these two communities, I’ve also been involved academically as a teaching assistant (COMP 321 computer systems &#x26; COMP 430 database systems) and most recently as a part of the <a href=\"http://plinycompute.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PlinyCompute</a> research group. During the breaks, I’ve enjoyed SWE internships at <a href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cisco Meraki</a>, <a href=\"https://www.united.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">United Airlines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/parkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ParkIT</a>, <a href=\"https://sensorfield.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sensorfield</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.csr.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Center for Space Research (NASA grant)</a>. In my spare time, I love to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/foerever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">side projects</a> and participate in <a href=\"https://devpost.com/sungsoocho\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hackathons</a>.</p>\n<p>Outside of the technical realm, I currently have a budding passion for photography and a full blown passion for coffee. I love food, traveling, and discovering new things to go deep on.

My name is Sung Soo (Anthony) Cho. I’m currently a software engineer on the application platform team at <a href=\"https://grandrounds.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Grand Rounds</a>, a healthcare startup in San Francisco. I recently graduated with a BS in Computer Science with a specialization in high performance data platforms from <a href=\"https://www.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice University</a> class of 2020.</p>\n<p>While at Rice I was most involved with the <a href=\"http://csclub.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice CS Club</a> and <a href=\"https://entrepreneurship.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Rice Entrepreneurship Community</a>. I served as President, External Vice President, Treasurer, HackRice 6 &#x26; 7 organizer, and Freshman Representative of Rice CS Club. In the Rice entrepreneurship space, my partner and I have won 11,000 USD from the LILIE New Entrepreneurs Grant and Rice Undergraduate Elevator Pitch Competition.</p>\n<p>Beyond these two communities, I was also involved academically as a teaching assistant (COMP 321 computer systems &#x26; COMP 430 database systems) and as a part of the <a href=\"http://plinycompute.rice.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">PlinyCompute</a> research group. During the breaks, I’ve enjoyed SWE internships at <a href=\"https://meraki.cisco.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Cisco Meraki</a>, <a href=\"https://www.united.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">United Airlines</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/parkit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">ParkIT</a>, <a href=\"https://sensorfield.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Sensorfield</a>, and the <a href=\"https://www.csr.utexas.edu/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Center for Space Research (NASA grant)</a>. In my spare time, I love to work on <a href=\"https://github.com/foerever\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">side projects</a> and participate in <a href=\"https://devpost.com/sungsoocho\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">hackathons</a>.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About Me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/image-2.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
